        <h4>ABOUT OUR COLLEGE</h4>
        <p>The Elphinstone Institution was established in 1827 under the Bombay Native Education
(Trust). The enlightened citizens of Mumbai collected a sum of Rs. 2,29,636 for the institution
and the name was given as a tribute to the departing Governor of Mumbai, Mountstuart
Elphinstone (6 October 1779 – 20 November 1859). The classes commenced in 1836 and
Elphinstone College separated from the High School in 1856. Thus the college was established
before the establishment of the University of Mumbai; and in fact in the inception stage the
classes of the University used to be held at the college. The college occupies a unique position
in the annals of higher education in the country. The building of the college with its Gothic
architecture has been classified as a Grade I Heritage structure. The college was awarded
the Asia-Pacific Heritage Award for Culture Heritage Conservation by the UNESCO. The
college has a Library with rich collection of over one lakh books. It is reaccredited with Grade
‘A’ by the NAAC.
