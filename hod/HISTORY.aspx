    <h4>OUR HISTORY</h4>
    <div class="container">
        <p>The year 1827 : A resolution was passed that an institution for the promotion of education should be established under the Bombay Native Education Society and be designated as "Elphinstone College". The enlightened citizens of Mumbai collected a sum of Rs.2,29,636.00, for teaching English Language, the Arts and Literature of Europe. This was a tribute to the departing Governor of Bombay, MountstuartElphinsotne (1819-27). The Elphinstone Institution was formally constituted in 1835.</p>

<p>The classes commenced in 1836 with the two Professors, Arthur Bedford Orlebar, Professor of Natural Philosophy and Harkness, Professor of General Literature. In April 1956, Elphinstone College, separated from the High School and became an institution in its own right. It was affiliated to the University of Mumbai in 1860.</p>

        <h4>Information Age and the Internet</h4>
        <p>The information age, made possible by the advent of electronic computers, is
characterized by the shift from traditional industry to an economy based on
information digitization. The onset of the Information Age is associated with
the Digital Revolution, just as the Industrial Revolution marked the onset of
the Industrial Age.</p>
<p>The Internet, synonymous with modern IT, was conceived of as a fail-proof
network that could connect computers together and be resistant to any single
point of failure. Because of decentralization, the Internet cannot be totally
destroyed in one event. If large areas are disabled, the information can be
easily rerouted. Its initial software applications were e-mail and computer file
transfer. </p>
        <p>Though the Internet itself has existed since 1969, it was with the invention of
the World Wide Web in 1989 by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee and its
introduction in 1991 that the Internet became an easily accessible network.
The Internet is now a global platform for accelerating the flow of information
and is pushing many, if not most, older forms of media into obsolescence.</p>
